## Documentation and Image Guidelines

### Directory Structure for Images

All images should follow this directory structure:

```bash
docs/
├── web/
│   ├── Part 1 - AI with Mac - Running AI Locally on a mac
│   ├── Part 2 - Getting Started with Python and Git for AI Development on Mac
│   └── ...
└── images/
    ├── part1/
    │   ├── apple-silicon-ai-hero.svg
    │   ├── mac-hardware-comparison.svg
    │   ├── unified-memory-architecture.svg
    │   └── llm-performance-comparison.svg
    ├── part2/
    │   └── ...
    └── ...

```

### Image Format Guidelines

1. **Preferred Formats**:
   - SVG: For diagrams, charts, and illustrations
   - PNG: For screenshots and photos when vector is not possible
   - JPEG: Only for photographic content where file size optimization is critical

2. **SVG Requirements**:
   - All technical diagrams should be created as SVGs for scalability
   - Include appropriate text elements within SVGs for accessibility
   - Use consistent color schemes aligned with the project palette
   - Optimize SVGs to remove unnecessary metadata

3. **Image Dimensions**:
   - Hero images: 1200 × 400 pixels
   - Diagrams: 800 × variable height (depending on content)
   - Screenshots: Maintain original resolution but optimize file size

### Image References in Markdown

When referencing images in Markdown documents, use the following convention:

```markdown
![Alt text](../images/part1/image-name.svg)
*Figure X: Descriptive caption that explains the content of the image.*
```

The path `../images/part1/` indicates a relative path from the Markdown document (in `docs/web/`) to the images directory.

Always include:

- Descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Figure number
- Detailed caption that provides context about the image
