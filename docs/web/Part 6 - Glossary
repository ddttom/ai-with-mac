Whether you're a beginner trying to make sense of technical jargon or an experienced developer looking for quick refreshers, this glossary will help you navigate the terminology of modern AI development on Mac.

## Core AI/ML Concepts

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The simulation of human intelligence in machines, particularly computer systems. Modern AI encompasses a broad range of capabilities including learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and more.

### Machine Learning (ML)

A subset of AI focused on building systems that learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms improve through experience and can adapt when exposed to new data.

### Deep Learning

A specialized form of machine learning involving artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") that can learn and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Deep learning powers many modern AI systems including language models, computer vision, and speech recognition.

### Model

A mathematical representation trained to recognize patterns in data. Models can range from simple linear equations to complex neural networks with billions of parameters.

### Model Architecture

The specific structure and organization of a machine learning model, including the number and configuration of layers, activation functions, and connections between components.

### Parameters

The internal variables of a model that are learned during training. For example, the weights and biases in a neural network. The "size" of a model is often expressed by its parameter count (e.g., a 7B model has 7 billion parameters).

### Token

A unit of text used by language models. Tokens can be words, parts of words, punctuation, or other meaningful language elements. LLMs process text by breaking it into tokens, typically using 3-4 tokens per English word on average.

### Inference

The process of using a trained model to make predictions on new data. For LLMs, inference is the process of generating text responses based on prompts.

### Fine-tuning

The process of further training a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to adapt it for a particular task or domain. Fine-tuning typically requires significantly less data and computational resources than training from scratch.

### Training

The process of teaching a model by showing it examples and adjusting its parameters to minimize errors. Training large models typically requires significant computational resources.

### Epoch

One complete pass through the entire training dataset. Training typically involves multiple epochs.

### Batch Size

The number of training examples used in one iteration of model training. Larger batch sizes generally enable faster training but require more memory.

### Loss Function

A method used to measure how well the model's predictions match the training data. The training process aims to minimize this loss.

### Optimizer

An algorithm used to update the model's parameters based on the computed loss to improve its performance. Common optimizers include Adam, SGD, and RMSprop.

### Overfitting

When a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.

### Underfitting

When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and new data.

### Validation and Test Sets

Separate portions of data not used for training that help evaluate model performance. The validation set is used during development to tune hyperparameters, while the test set evaluates the final model.

### Prompt Engineering

The practice of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to elicit desired outputs from language models. This includes strategies like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and system instructions.

### Context Length

The maximum number of tokens that a language model can process in a single prompt. Context length determines how much text the model can "remember" and reference when generating responses.

### Temperature

A parameter controlling randomness in text generation. Higher temperature (closer to 1.0) makes output more creative but potentially less factual, while lower temperature (closer to 0) makes output more deterministic and focused.

### Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling

A text generation strategy that samples from the smallest possible set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability p. This helps generate diverse but still contextually appropriate text.

### Top-k Sampling

A text generation strategy that considers only the k most likely next tokens at each step, improving output quality by filtering out unlikely tokens.

### Quantization

A technique to reduce model size and improve inference speed by representing weights with fewer bits (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit instead of 32-bit floating point). Quantization is essential for running large models on devices with limited memory.

## Performance Optimization Terms

### Lazy Evaluation

A computation strategy where operations are not executed immediately but deferred until their results are needed. MLX uses lazy evaluation to optimize computation graphs.

### Zero-Copy Operations

Data processing techniques that avoid copying data between different memory locations, significantly improving performance by reducing memory bandwidth usage. Apple's unified memory architecture enables efficient zero-copy operations.

### JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation

A technique that compiles code at runtime rather than ahead of time, allowing for dynamic optimizations based on the actual execution environment.

### Mixed Precision

Using a combination of different numeric precisions (typically 16-bit and 32-bit floating point) during model training or inference to balance performance and accuracy.

### Tokenization

The process of converting text into tokens that can be processed by language models. Efficient tokenization is critical for performance in text-based AI applications.

### Memory Bandwidth

The rate at which data can be read from or stored into memory. Higher memory bandwidth enables faster processing of large datasets and models.

### Throughput
