# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

2025-03-20 11:40:32 - Initial creation of Memory Bank.

## Framework Selection

**Decision**: Support both MLX and PyTorch frameworks

**Rationale**:

- MLX is optimized specifically for Apple Silicon but is newer and has a smaller ecosystem
- PyTorch has broader adoption and more pre-existing models but requires Metal optimization
- Supporting both provides comprehensive coverage and allows for framework comparison

**Implementation Details**:

- Separate examples for each framework (mlx_example.py, pytorch_example.py)
- Conversion utilities between frameworks (convert_model.py)
- Combined application demonstrating both frameworks working together

## Project Structure

**Decision**: Organize the repository by educational parts rather than by technology

**Rationale**:

- Aligns with the educational article series structure
- Provides a clear learning progression from basic to advanced topics
- Makes it easier for users to follow along with the corresponding articles

**Implementation Details**:

- Top-level directories for each part (part1/, part2/, etc.)
- Consistent subdirectory structure within each part (examples/, scripts/, etc.)
- Shared resources in common directories (models/, data/, etc.)

## Model Management

**Decision**: Implement a model registry and versioning system

**Rationale**:

- Models are large and require special handling
- Users need guidance on managing model files
- Version control for models is different from code version control

**Implementation Details**:

- Model registry implementation (model_registry.py)
- Git LFS integration for large file storage
- Download scripts and utilities for popular models

## Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Focus on quantization and memory efficiency

**Rationale**:

- Apple Silicon Macs have limited memory compared to server hardware
- Quantization significantly reduces memory requirements with minimal quality loss
- Different Mac configurations require different optimization strategies

**Implementation Details**:

- Quantization scripts for different models
- Memory usage monitoring and optimization
- Configuration-specific guidance (8GB vs. 16GB vs. 32GB+)

## Documentation Approach

**Decision**: Comprehensive documentation with visual aids

**Rationale**:

- Complex concepts are easier to understand with visual representations
- Different learning styles benefit from different content formats
- Diagrams help illustrate system architecture and data flow

**Implementation Details**:

- SVG diagrams for technical concepts
- Consistent image formatting and organization
- Detailed captions and alt text for accessibility
