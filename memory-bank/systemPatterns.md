# System Patterns

This file documents recurring patterns and standards used in the project.

2025-03-20 11:40:49 - Initial creation of Memory Bank.

## Coding Patterns

### Script Organization

1. **Command-Line Interface Pattern**
   - Use argparse for command-line argument parsing
   - Provide sensible defaults for all parameters
   - Include help text and examples in the argument descriptions
   - Example: `part3/simple_chat.py`, `part3/document_qa.py`

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive information
   - Store configuration in separate JSON/YAML files when appropriate
   - Provide sample configuration files with documentation
   - Example: `part3/scripts/huggingface_login.sh`

3. **Error Handling**
   - Use try/except blocks for operations that might fail
   - Provide informative error messages with potential solutions
   - Gracefully degrade functionality when resources are limited
   - Example: Memory handling in model loading

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
   - Example usage in comments
   - Type hints where appropriate
   - Example: `part2/examples/docstring_example.py`

## Architectural Patterns

### Model Management

1. **Model Registry Pattern**
   - Central registry for tracking available models
   - Metadata storage for model capabilities and requirements
   - Versioning system for model updates
   - Example: `part5/model_registry.py`

2. **Adapter Pattern for Models**
   - Consistent interface across different model types
   - Framework-specific implementations hidden behind common API
   - Allows for easy switching between models
   - Example: Model loading in various applications

3. **Pipeline Architecture**
   - Modular processing stages (tokenization, inference, post-processing)
   - Composable components that can be reused
   - Clear data flow between stages
   - Example: Document Q&A system

4. **Resource Management**
   - Explicit loading and unloading of resources
   - Memory usage monitoring and optimization
   - Batch processing for efficiency
   - Example: Batch inference in `part3/batch_process.py`

## Testing Patterns

1. **Environment Verification**
   - Check for required dependencies
   - Verify hardware capabilities
   - Test basic functionality
   - Example: `notebooks/01_Environment_Test.ipynb`

2. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Consistent methodology for measuring performance
   - Comparison across different hardware configurations
   - Metrics for both speed and memory usage
   - Example: Framework comparison examples

3. **Regression Testing**
   - Ensure new optimizations don't break existing functionality
   - Compare output quality before and after changes
   - Version control for test cases and expected results
   - Example: Model quantization testing

## Deployment Patterns

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Reproducible environment creation
   - Dependency management with requirements.txt
   - Virtual environment isolation
   - Example: Setup scripts in `part2/scripts/`

2. **Web Application Structure**
   - Separation of frontend and backend
   - RESTful API design
   - Static file serving
   - Example: Combined app in `part5/combined_app/`

3. **Model Serving**
   - Efficient loading and caching
   - Request batching when possible
   - Graceful handling of resource constraints
   - Example: Server implementation in `part5/combined_app/scripts/server.py`
